The implementation of different searching algorithms should be based on
the abstract Search class as given in the following diagram:

\frametitle{Linear Search}
Linear search is a method for finding a target value within a list.
It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match
is found or until all the elements have been searched.\\

Find 37\\

The result value is 2 (position where 37 is found)\\

Runtime: $O(n)$

\frametitle{Binary Search}
Binary search finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
It compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal,
the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the
remaining half until it is successful.\\
